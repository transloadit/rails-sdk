# transloadit-rails

Fantastic file uploading for your Rails application.

## Description

This is the official Rails gem for [Transloadit](transloadit.com). It allows
you to automate uploading files through the Transloadit REST API.

## Install

```bash
$ gem install transloadit-rails
```

## Getting started

To get started, you need to add the 'transloadit-rails' gem to your Rails
project's Gemfile.

```bash
$ echo "gem 'transloadit-rails'" >> Gemfile
```

Now update your bundle and run the generator.

```bash
$ bundle install
$ rails g transloadit:install
```

## Configuration

Edit `config/transloadit.yml`. It has an `auth` section for your transloadit
credentials and a `templates` section to define or refer to existing
templates.

```yaml
auth:
  key   : '4d2e...'
  secret: '8ad1...' # optional, but highly recommended

templates:
  # template identified by template_id
  s3_store: '4d2e...'
  
  # template defined inline
  image_resize:
    steps:
      resize:
        robot : '/image/resize'
        width : 320
        height: 200
```

## Usage

Refer to the templates with the `transloadify` helper. This requires jQuery,
and loads the [Transloadit jQuery plugin](https://github.com/transloadit/jquery-sdk).
It also uses JavaScript to ensure your form is encoded as `multipart/form-data`.

```erb
<%= form_for :upload, :html => { :id => 'upload' } do |form| %>
  <%= form.transloadit :s3_store %>
  <%= form.label      :file, 'File to upload' %>
  <%= form.file_field :file %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>

<%= transloadit_jquerify :upload %>
```

If you want to use the automatic transload parameter decoding, you have to include
the Transloadit::Rails::ParamsDecoder module into your controller

```ruby
class YourController
  include Transloadit::Rails::ParamsDecoder
end
```

that way the param[:transloadit] is automatically decoded for you, if it exists

## Tutorial

In this tutorial, you are going to learn how to use transloadit in a freshly
setup rails project.

If you haven't already done so, go ahead and install Rails.

```bash
$ gem install rails
```

With rails installed, let's create a new app called 'my_app'.

```bash
$ rails new my_app
$ cd my_app
```

In order to use transloadit in this app, we need to add the gem to our Gemfile
and bundle things up.

```bash
$ echo "gem 'transloadit-rails'" >> Gemfile
$ bundle install
```

With that in place, it's time to generate our transloadit configuration, as
well as a basic UploadsController and a dummy Upload model.

```bash
$ rails g transloadit:install
$ rails g controller uploads new create
$ rails g model upload
$ rake  db:migrate
```

The controller generator we just executed has probably put two GET routes into
your `config/routes.rb`. We don't want those, so lets go ahead an overwrite
them with this.

```ruby
MyApp::Application.routes.draw do
  resources :uploads
end
```

Next we need to configure our `config/transloadit.yml` file. For this tutorial,
just put in your credentials, and define an image resize step as indicated
below:

```yaml
auth:
  key   : '4d2e...'
  secret: '8ad1...'

templates:
  image_resize:
    steps:
      resize:
        robot : '/image/resize'
        format: 'jpg'
        width : 320
        height: 200
```

Alright, time to create our upload form. In order to do that, please open
`app/views/uploads/new.html.erb`, and put the following code in:

```erb
<%= javascript_include_tag '//ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.5.1/jquery.min.js' %>

<h1>Upload an image</h1>
<%= form_for Upload.new, :html => { :id => 'upload' } do |form| %>
  <%= form.transloadit :image_resize %>
  <%= form.label      :file, 'File to upload' %>
  <%= form.file_field :file %>
  <%= form.submit %>
<% end %>

<%= transloadit_jquerify :upload, :wait => true %>
```

With this in place, we can modify the `app/views/uploads/create.html.erb` view
to render the uploaded and resized image:

```erb
<h1>Resized upload image</h1>
<%= image_tag params[:transloadit][:results][:resize].first[:url] %>
```

That's it. If you've followed the steps closely, you should now be able to
try your first upload. Don't forget do start your rails server first:

```bash
$ rails server
```

Then go to http://localhost:3000/uploads/new, and upload an image. If you did
everything right, you should see the uploaded and resized file as soon as the
upload finishes.
